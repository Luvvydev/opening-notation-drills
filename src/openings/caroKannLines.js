The Caro-Kann Defense starts with 1. e4 c6 and aims for a solid central challenge with ...d5
while keeping Black's light-squared bishop flexible.

These drills cover the main student-facing structures you listed:
- Advance Variation (3. e5) with the key ...c5 break and typical pressure on e5 and d4
- Exchange and Panov-style structures (3. exd5 / 4. c4) where piece activity and pawn structure matter
- Classical / Two Knights setups (3. Nc3) with development and early piece pressure themes

Each line includes move-by-move explanations that state the concrete purpose:
what is being attacked or defended, what pawn break is being prepared, and what concession is being forced.
