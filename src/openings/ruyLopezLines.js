// SEO / page intro text for Ruy Lopez drills
export const ruyLopezSEOText = `
The Ruy Lopez (Spanish Opening) starts with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5.
White pressures the e5 pawn and usually aims for long-term positional pressure,
while Black can choose between solid defenses and sharp counterplay.

This page provides Ruy Lopez move-order drills focused on repetition, not theory dumps.
Each line is a concrete sequence you can practice until the moves feel automatic.
