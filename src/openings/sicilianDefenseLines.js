export const sicilianSEOText = `
The Sicilian Defense is the most popular response to 1.e4 and leads to unbalanced,
dynamic positions. This opening emphasizes asymmetrical pawn structures, active
piece play, and precise move orders.

This page provides Sicilian Defense opening drills for players who want to memorize
common setups and early continuations without wading through dense theory.
The focus is on repetition of correct moves rather than deep analysis.

These drills are best suited for players who already play the Sicilian and want
their openings to survive beyond the first few moves in real games.
